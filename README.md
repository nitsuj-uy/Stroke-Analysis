# Stroke-Analysis 
  

This paper will present the analysis of health data and the prediction of whether or not a person will suffer a stroke. Data cleaning, transformations, and exploration has been done to discover what the data unfolds. It will be established that a multiple regression model falls short when dealing with a categorical response variable. The cleaned and transformed data will provide smooth implementation of logistic regression modeling.
